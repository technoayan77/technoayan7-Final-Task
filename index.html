        <img src="img/movie1.jpeg" alt="Harry" id="image1" style="width: 100%; height: 50%">
        <p>Harry Potter is an orphaned boy brought up by his unkind Muggle (non-magical) aunt and uncle. At the age of
          eleven, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid informs him that he is actually a wizard and that his parents were murdered
          by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Voldemort also attempted to kill one-year-old Harry on the same night,
          but his killing curse mysteriously rebounded and reduced him to a weak and helpless form. Harry became
          extremely famous in the Wizarding World as a result. Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts School of
          Witchcraft and Wizardry and learns about magic. During the year, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and
          Hermione Granger become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone which is being kept within the
          school.</p>

          the last. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, leaving students and ghosts petrified by an unleashed
          monster. Harry must face up to claims that he is the heir of Salazar Slytherin (founder of the Chamber), learn
          that he can speak Parseltongue, and also discover the properties of a mysterious diary, only to find himself
          trapped within the Chamber of Secrets itself.</p>

        <p>During Harry's fourth year, Hogwarts plays host to a legendary event: the Triwizard Tournament. Three
          European schools participate in the tournament, with three 'champions' representing each school in the deadly
          tasks. The Goblet of Fire chooses Fleur Delacour, Viktor Krum, and Cedric Diggory to compete against each
          other. However, curiously, Harry's name is also produced from the Goblet thus making him a fourth champion,
          which results in a terrifying encounter with a reborn Lord Voldemort.</p>

          "neither can live while the other survives." The rebellion involving the students of Hogwarts, secret
          organisation Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic, and the Death Eaters begins.</p>

          Hogwarts as a professor as there is a vacancy to fill. There is a more important reason, however, for
          Slughorn's return. While in a Potions lesson, Harry takes possession of a strangely annotated school textbook,
          inscribed 'This is the property of the Half-Blood Prince'. Draco Malfoy struggles to carry out a mission
